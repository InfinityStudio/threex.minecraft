# A-Frame Support
You can include it in your a-frame too - [a-frame example](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.minecraft.js/a-frame/examples/aframe-minecraft.html)

You can download the components from [here](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.minecraft.js/a-frame/build/aframe-minecraft.js)

# Futures
- make an actual [threex README.md](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.sample/blob/master/README.md)
- improve a-frame support
  - add the player with it as an entity
    - https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/primitives/#register-a-primitive
  - DONE package all js in a build/aframe-minecraft.min.js
